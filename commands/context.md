# Load Project Context

Quickly load ShelfWins Studio project context to understand current state.

## Instructions

Read the following files to understand the project:
1. `CHANGELOG.md` - Feature history and what's been built
2. `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Current priorities and roadmap (focus on P6 and P7 sections)

Then provide a brief summary:

1. **Current Phase**: What development phase are we in?
2. **Recent Work**: What were the last 3-5 commits? (run `git log --oneline -5`)
3. **Next Priorities**: Based on DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, what should we work on next?
4. **Branch Status**: What branch are we on? Any uncommitted changes? (run `git status`)

Keep the summary concise - no more than 15-20 lines.
