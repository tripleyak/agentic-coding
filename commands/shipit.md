Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a descriptive commit message, then push to origin/main.

Follow the standard git commit process:
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand what changed
2. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
3. Create a commit with a clear message describing the changes
4. Push to origin/main

Use the standard commit message format with the 🤖 Generated footer.
